# Accessibility

## Built-in

### Keyboard navgiation
<P>
Keyboard inputs are handled by @kaynora/ui with no additional work needed by the user. Complex components 
respond to keyboard inputs as determined by intuitive, commonly implemented input patterns and by WAI-ARIA 
example patterns.
</P>

### Focus management
<P>
The library manages the document active element through restoring focus to the trigger in case of components that 
display content on activation of a trigger, and through focus trapping in the Modal component.
</P>

## Extensible

### The visually hidden pattern
<P>
The [Invisible](/docs/components/core/invisible) component allows for adding visually hidden text to the document which is visible to assistive technologies. 
This allows for adding accessible names and labels to elements that visually benefit from minimal textual description.
</P>

### The internal accessor prop
<P>
The `internal` prop can be used to directly modify role, aria-* and other relevant attributes where the library's 
built-in accessible attributes and the Invisible component are not sufficient for describing an element to assistive technologies.
