# Getting started

## Installation

### 1. Install the library

<P>
Use the following command or its equivalent for your package manager to install @kaynora/ui.
</P>

```shell
npm install @kaynora/ui
```


### 2. Import base styles

<P>
The index.css file will set baseline styles and should be imported in the root of your application.
</P>

```jsx
import '@kaynora/ui/dist/index.css'
```


### 3. Set the application theme

<P>
The `data-theme` attribute must be set on the document root in order for the library's 
styling to work. Accepted values for this attribute are `'light'` and `'dark'`.
</P>

```jsx
export default function () {
  return (
    <html data-theme='light'>
      <body>
        <App />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```
